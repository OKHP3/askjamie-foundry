- Never commingle client-sensitive content with public portfolio artifacts.
- Update `manifest.yaml` when the status, visibility, or scope changes.
- Treat any content labeled `bfs_firewall` or `visibility_lock: permanent-private`
  as confidential and not for public sharing or summarization.

  guidance.
