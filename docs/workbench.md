# AskJamie Found-Ry workbench

## Portable skills and adapters

New drafts default to Portable Agent Skill. Choose Plugin adapter plan or Connector
adapter plan under Kind when composing a skill with external tools. Record a Skill
trigger, source, reusable Instructions and Output contract. Adapter plans also
require Adapter platform and Tool and permission requirements. Record conversion
mapping and losses under Evidence. Do not put credentials in any draft field.

Download produces `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`, supporting procedure and license,
`docs/conversion.md`, and `adapters/plan.json` alongside existing governance and
source evidence. The plan is not installable; host compatibility remains unverified.
Read [the product and migration contract](skill-first-foundry.md). Legacy kinds,
backups, revision history, supplied-response checks, and decision runners remain
supported. Existing drafts are not automatically converted.


Build an interpretive capability from an idea, test its decisions, and keep the
source and evidence with the result. Everything stays on this computer.

## Start

Use Python 3.11 or newer from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m workbench --port 8765
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8765. Stop with Ctrl+C. The private interface has no build
step. The separate `public/` directory is a static, read-only Pages artifact
and never reads this server or its local state.
The application binds to loopback and makes no model-provider calls. It is a
single-user local tool, not a hosted multiuser service. Do not proxy it onto
the internet or expose it through a Replit preview without a separate access
control design.

## Build a capability

1. Create a project or choose a starter. A starter is editable sample content;
   it becomes a saved project only when you save it.
2. Define its purpose, audience, original source and source reference. Source
   references are your provenance claims, not independently verified citations.
3. Write the instructions, constraints and output contract. Choose an assistant,
   decision tool or guided workflow. Keep the scope useful and specific.
4. For a decision tool, add question and result nodes. Each question has Yes and
   No paths. Run the preview to follow a real path and inspect the result.
5. For a workflow, write an ordered sequence of steps. It exports a checklist;
   it does not run external actions.
6. Add tests. Decision tests run the graph. Assistant/workflow checks compare a
   response you supply against required and forbidden text. They never call an
   AI model; an empty response remains unrun.
7. Select helpful Skillz references, preserving each entry's family, maturity,
   evidence status and source commit. Selecting a reference does not install or
   execute a skill.
8. Save, validate and export. Resolve any naming, missing-content or graph errors.

The brief also records a planning `target` and `phase`, while Evidence records
what has been checked and what remains unknown. These labels guide review; they
do not provision a Custom GPT, call a model, or graduate a package.

## Lifecycle and recovery

From Projects, use **Download backup** to save a version-one JSON envelope
containing this workbench’s projects, complete revision history, and evaluation
records. **Import backup** requires both a browser confirmation and the server’s
explicit confirmation field. The server validates every project, revision,
history entry, evaluation reference, and supported draft field before opening a
transaction. A malformed file leaves the existing database untouched.
History must contain every revision from one through the saved revision, and
each evaluation must reference a revision in that history. JSON downloads are
limited to 63 MiB and 1,000 records in each collection; the import request has
a separate 64 MiB allowance for the confirmation envelope. Larger stores must
use the stopped-server directory backup procedure below. The download is
rejected explicitly if it would exceed the import contract. Ordinary draft
requests retain their 1 MiB limit.

Saved projects can be **duplicated** into a fresh private revision-one draft.
Duplicate evaluation history is intentionally not copied. **Delete** requires a
saved project and explicit confirmation, then removes its history and
evaluations with the project. These controls never alter the canonical registry
or publish a package.

Saved revisions and evaluation runs are durable. A test run belongs to a
specific revision; editing creates a new revision and does not inherit a pass.
If a second tab has saved changes, stale updates fail instead of overwriting
its work. Reopen the saved version to reconcile before saving again.

## What a package contains

The ZIP starts from the canonical `_template/` layout and includes a valid
manifest, source, instructions, specification, test cases, selected skill
metadata, evaluation records and a pending registry proposal. Decision packages
also include an offline HTML runner. Open its `index.html` to use it without the
Found-Ry server. Assistant packages contain authored behavior assets for manual
use with a chosen platform; they are not automatically provisioned GPTs.

Generated README instructions describe the exported package. No unrelated
project, entire private registry or local database belongs in a ZIP.

## Privacy and registration

Every draft and package is private. Client overlays, client organization
identities, firewall flags and permanent-private locks activate protection on
save. Established protection and client identity cannot be cleared afterward.
Public graduation remains an explicit maintainer decision outside the app.

The registry view shows local governance records. A draft export produces a
proposal, not a new registry entry or remote GitHub repository. Existing and
retired capability codes remain reserved; an overlay must reference its governed
parent. Enterprise Sleuth variants use aj03 with a unique repository name.
Review the proposal before applying it through the existing governance
process.

## Storage and backup

The default data directory is `.foundry-data/`, ignored by Git. Choose another
private location with `--data-dir /path/to/private-state`. On POSIX systems the app restricts the dedicated data directory to the owner
and sets SQLite state files to owner read/write. This is not encryption;
Windows account access must be managed through operating-system permissions.
The SQLite database
holds original source, project revisions and evaluation records. Protect it as
private content. Stop the application before copying the complete data directory
for backup. Restore that directory and restart with the same `--data-dir`.

The bundled Skillz catalog is a dated public metadata snapshot. It works
offline and does not silently refresh. See [snapshot provenance](../workbench/data/README.md).

### Approved policy for any future hosted copy

The local workbench does not automatically retain, upload, or delete backup
files or ZIPs after you download or copy them; the owner controls those local
copies. If a future hosted service is separately approved, it must apply the
owner-approved schedule: 35 days for daily snapshots and destructive-action
recovery points, 12 weeks for weekly recovery points, 7 days for generated ZIPs,
and 12 months for content-free audit records. Explicit owner holds pause the
affected deletion until release.

Hosted deletion must include active rows, revisions, evaluations, temporary and
object-vault copies, download objects, backups, indexes, caches, and derived
metadata. Access is revoked first, but deletion is not described as complete
until the provider supplies evidence for every in-scope copy. User-downloaded
copies remain outside service control. Encryption keys must be owner-controlled
and separate from the data service.

A hosted restore must first enter an isolated environment with public routes,
egress, normal user access, and downloads disabled. Manifest, checksum, schema,
privacy flags, workspace ownership, revision/evaluation integrity, and
cross-workspace isolation must pass before any separately approved promotion.
Cleanup remains pending until provider evidence confirms deletion of the
temporary restore and its copies. The full policy and runbook are in the
[hosted authoring boundary](hosted-authoring-boundary.md#6-backup-and-retention-design).
No host has been selected or certified, and this policy does not authorize
hosting or upload of local private state.

## Verification and limits

```bash
python scripts/validate-manifest.py manifest.yaml
python scripts/check-registry.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

These checks cover the local runtime and governance contracts. They do not
establish hosted deployment, model quality, external GPT behavior, or Replit
workspace parity. The [research](research/2026-09-07-universe/universe-research.md)
and [execution plan](research/2026-09-07-universe/execution-plan.md) record evidence
and unresolved access limits.

For the public artifact, run `python scripts/build-public-artifact.py --build`.
It checks relative asset references and rejects private/runtime markers before
writing `dist/pages/`. A Pages release is manual and separately reviewed.

## Recovering a bad Pages publication

The Pages artifact and the local workbench have separate data boundaries. Pages
is built only from `public/`. The local workbench database, `.foundry-data/`,
backups, client records, and generated private packages are never inputs to a
Pages recovery. Do not restore, import, delete, or copy private workbench data
to fix a public publication.

Use this procedure when a deployed page has incorrect content or an unexpected
link:

1. Record the public URL, the failed or suspect Pages workflow run, and the
   deployed commit. Inspect the corresponding `public/` source and determine
   whether the fix is a narrow correction or a revert of the offending
   public-source commit.
2. Fetch the latest `origin/main` and create a task branch from it. Change only
   the affected public source. `dist/pages/` is generated output and is not the
   source of truth.
3. From the repository root, run:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/build-public-artifact.py --build
   python3 scripts/build-public-artifact.py
   python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
   ```

   Review the generated `dist/pages/` contents and confirm that the correction
   removes the bad content without introducing private workbench or runtime
   markers.
4. Open a pull request from the task branch into protected `main`. Wait for the
   supported Python validation check and merge the reviewed correction through
   GitHub. Never force-push or rewrite protected `main`.
5. After the merge, manually dispatch
   [AskJamie Pages (manual release)](../.github/workflows/pages.yaml) from
   `main`. The safe release unit is the reviewed merge commit on protected
   `main` followed by this manual workflow. Confirm the workflow run identifies
   that merge commit before accepting the deployment.
6. Confirm the workflow smoke test passes, then open the public URL and check
   the expected repository path, visible content, and external links. Retain the
   suspect run and corrective commit as evidence of what was changed.

If a narrow fix is unsafe because later public changes are mixed together,
prepare a separate revert commit on the task branch and send it through the
same pull-request boundary. This restores public source history without
rewriting `main`. If the source is correct but the publication still needs to
be retried, dispatch the same reviewed `main` release again and verify the
result. Do not dispatch an unreviewed branch or attempt to repair Pages by
changing private workbench state.
