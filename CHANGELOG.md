# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Corrected the October 1 technology refresh scope and Python 3.11/3.12 security-line references.
- Reworked the README around the FoundRy experience, working entry links,
  cross-platform startup instructions, and a linked presentation-asset directory.
- Added original AskJamie workshop artwork, social-card metadata, browser and
  home-screen icons, a Safari pinned-tab mark, and a public-site web manifest.
  Kept private authoring separate and Pages publication manual.
- Corrected the live Pages check to the verified lowercase repository path,
  `/askjamie-foundry/`; the former mixed-case URL returned 404.

- Recovered seven completed Replit commits with preserved history: clearer
  draft recovery identities, safe rapid project switching, a pinned mentor
  deferral record, and manual Pages content verification and recovery guidance.
- Made public artifact tests use the active Python interpreter and loopback
  test servers. Browser checks now await the saved message and delayed project
  response instead of accepting timing-dependent results.

- Audited application, test, CI, documentation and host technology versions
  against primary stable-release sources, with separate Windows/Replit evidence.
- Added daily browser dependency update coverage, daily release-audit reports,
  and weekly compatibility checks including the latest stable Python. Kept
  owner-reviewed merges, private runtime state and manual Pages publication.

- Reject non-mapping approval records without crashing the governance report,
  remove the approval unknown once verified, preserve zero-valued draft revision
  metadata, and explicitly close persistent browser contexts before reopening.

- Recovered fourteen additional Replit commits through a checksum-verified Git
  bundle and retained their history for fast-forward synchronization.
- Fixed Windows restore-location evidence and used the active Python interpreter
  for the hosted-isolation proof. Kept its provider certification blocked.
- Made the browser evidence workflow test compatible with reviewed action
  upgrades and documented the separate authentication and protected-main paths.

- Adopted the owner's solo-maintainer merge policy: zero external approvals,
  while retaining mandatory PRs, strict CI, administrator enforcement, and
  protection against force pushes and branch deletion.

- Recovered ten pending Replit commits through a preserved Git bundle and a
  protected-main PR; documented the workflow-authorized transfer procedure.
- Fixed the missing Python heredoc terminator in browser acceptance CI and
  synchronized agent guidance with the public/private surface boundary.
- Made the public artifact build result consistent across Windows and POSIX.
- Fixed review findings in backup size limits, revision/evaluation validation,
  maximum-length duplicate naming, and browser evidence punctuation.

- Added an evidence-led mentor parity matrix and made the public Pages
  orientation artifact distinct from the private loopback authoring workbench.
- Added a regional governance audit design with explicit evidence tiers,
  protected-client checks, registry immutability, and owner-scoped approval.
- Added confirmed project duplication/deletion and versioned, validated,
  transactional backup/import recovery controls.
- Added a design-only hosted authoring boundary covering authentication,
  workspace routing, client-record isolation, backup retention, and the
  evidence required to prove that private state and generated packages cannot
  leak. No hosted runtime or provider integration was added.

All notable changes to **AskJamie FoundRy** are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

- Recovered F17-F20 onboarding, validated synthetic pilots and controlled Skillz
  refresh guidance; corrected the README public-source description.
- Protected `main` with required review approval and the supported-Python
  compatibility check; documented the merge policy and ensured the check runs
  for every pull request targeting `main`.


### Collaboration and repository visibility
- Added shared task ownership and handoff instructions for ChatGPT/Codex,
  Claude, Copilot, and Replit, with cost-conscious routing and validation reuse.
- Recorded the owner's intentional public source-repository visibility while
  preserving private child defaults, draft state, and graduation controls.


### Added
- Local AskJamie capability workbench with durable drafts, decision preview,
  evidence records, Skillz references and governed repository-package exports.
- Seven-element universe research, implementation contract and operating guide.
- Application and privacy regression checks in the compatibility workflow.

### Fixed
- Enterprise Sleuth variants can export with their required aj03 code while
  duplicate repository names and incorrect variant codes remain blocked.
- Restricted local POSIX state permissions and rejected non-finite draft numbers.
- Corrected Skillz search-field styling and the registry validator return annotation.
- Registry validation now invokes its schema and rejects inconsistent protected
  entries; conversation-design and RAG families align with the manifest schema.


### Changed
- Clarified OverKill as the centroid and baseline, its intentionally public
  Found-Ry as mentor pattern, and reciprocal mentoring among regional Found-Rys.
- Reconciled relay documentation and registry notes with the 2026-07-27 removal
  of historical AJ01 and BRG00 staged content.
- Removed the obsolete `scripts/manifest-audit.py` validator and repaired the
  lightweight FoundRy posture reports to use current repository paths.
- Removed the raw Foundry evaluation workspace after preserving its historical
  aggregate evidence, and refreshed the local skill catalog from 18 to 50 skills.
- Removed the obsolete duplicate `okhp3-repl-repo-janitor copy` skill snapshot;
  the maintained `okhp3-replit-repl-janitor` package is the canonical successor.
- Added a scoped AskJamie repository and local-clone inventory, including the
  canonical-remote versus legacy-origin reconciliation finding.
- Added `docs/technology-inventory.md`, pinned Python dependencies, an active
  compatibility workflow, and weekly Dependabot tracking for Python packages
  and GitHub Actions.
- `AGENTS.md` aligned with the current relay structure, validation commands,
  visibility controls, and known script gaps.
- `CLAUDE.md` retained as a short pointer to the canonical `AGENTS.md` guide.
- `replit.md` corrected to distinguish repository metadata from staged workflows.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **`docs/adr/` scaffold** — ADR directory required by the `architecture-decision-records`
  skill: `README.md` index, `template.md`, and three founding ADRs:
  - `0001-relay-repository-pattern.md` — why this is a governance relay, not an app
  - `0002-agents-md-as-ai-context-file.md` — AGENTS.md chosen over CLAUDE.md; rationale
  - `0003-uppercase-skill-md-naming.md` — SKILL.md/README.md uppercase convention

### Fixed
- **Skill frontmatter — `description: >-` parser issue** — `>-` YAML block scalar
  caused three skill descriptions to render as the literal string `>-` in the catalog.
  Fixed to `>` in `okhp3-custom-gpt-builder`, `okhp3-custom-gpt-readiness`, and
  `okhp3-gpt-skill-conversion-plan`.
- **Skill frontmatter — missing version warnings** — `architecture-decision-records`
  and `frontend-design` had no `metadata.version`; added `metadata.version: "1.0.0"`
  to both. Catalog now runs with zero warnings.

### Verified
- **`okhp3-skill-promotion` mirror** — byte-for-byte exact (`exact: true`, all 9 files
  with matching SHA-256 hashes). No sync required.
- **Skill catalog** — refreshed to 18 skills, zero errors, zero warnings.
- **18-skill compliance audit** — reviewed all Agent Skills against repo structure;
  3 N/A (no UI/React code), all others pass or have been remediated.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added
- `AGENTS.md` §11 Writing and Style Rules — merged from `CLAUDE.md`: no em dashes,
  punchy-line preservation, ROY verbosity principle, AutoCAD R10 lock.
- `AGENTS.md` §12 Project Context — merged from `CLAUDE.md`: Notion Anchor URL,
  local workspace paths (Windows + Mac), and related repository links.

### Removed
- `CLAUDE.md` — contents merged into `AGENTS.md` §§11–12; file deleted.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Per-folder README / ABOUT files (11 new documents):**
  - `_template/ABOUT.md` — meta-description of the scaffold folder (preserving
    `_template/README.md` as the child-repo template placeholder)
  - `archive/README.md` — overview of both staged capabilities, graduation process
  - `assets/README.md` — shared brand assets structure and usage rules
  - `docs/README.md` — index of all 5 governance documents and workflows staging dir
  - `gpt-aj01-askjamie-resume-representative/README.md` — legacy folder orientation,
    redirect to canonical archive copy, AJ01 capability overview
  - `okhp3-brandguard-sentinel/README.md` — legacy folder orientation with BFS
    firewall notice, redirect to canonical archive copy, BRG00 capability overview
  - `registry/README.md` — registry table (9 repos), status values, how to add entries
  - `schemas/README.md` — schema summaries, validation commands, upgrade procedure
  - `scripts/README.md` — expanded to document all 7 scripts with usage examples

### Changed
- `README.md` — "Repository Structure" section replaced with "Repository Catalog":
  four subsections (Governance and Infrastructure, Capability Efforts Staged for
  Graduation, Legacy Folders, Root Files), each with links to per-folder READMEs.
- `assets/brand/README.md` — removed stale note about brand files being at root
  (they have been moved to `assets/brand/` and the root copies removed).

### Removed
- `askjamie-brand-standards.docx` (root) — duplicate of `assets/brand/` copy; removed.
- `askjamie-brand-standards.pdf` (root) — duplicate of `assets/brand/` copy; removed.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- `scripts/normalize_filenames.py` — canonical filename normalization utility.
  Converts ™, —, é, &, ,, #, (, ), ' and other non-standard characters to
  ASCII-compliant kebab-case slugs. Supports dry-run (default) and `--apply`,
  `--recursive`, `--ascii-only`, `--include-dirs`, and `--exclude-path` flags.
  Fixed NFKD transliteration so accented letters (é → e) are retained rather
  than dropped. Preserves `PRESERVE_NAMES` list (README, CHANGELOG, AGENTS, etc.)
  and Windows-reserved basename guard.

### Changed
- **Full filename normalization pass — 74 renames applied across the repository.**
  All file and folder names now comply with GitHub and Replit naming best practices
  (ASCII only, kebab-case separators, no special shell/URL characters):
  - Root: `askjamie™-brand-standards.*` → `askjamie-brand-standards.*`
  - Legacy folder: `gpt-aj01-askjamie™-—-résumé-representative/` →
    `gpt-aj01-askjamie-resume-representative/`
  - Legacy folder: `OKHP3-BrandGaurd-Sentinel/` → `okhp3-brandguard-sentinel/`
    (also corrects "Gaurd" → "Guard" typo)
  - Legacy subfolder: `BFS-Framing-Intelligent-Futures/` →
    `bfs-framing-intelligent-futures/`
  - `archive/aj01-resume-representative/hr_guidebook_2025-(1).pdf` →
    `hr_guidebook_2025-1.pdf`
  - `archive/brg00-builders-firstsource/##-builders-firstsource-gpt-—-core.md` →
    `builders-firstsource-gpt-core.md`
  - All 32 knowledge files in `archive/brg00-builders-firstsource/knowledge/` and
    `okhp3-brandguard-sentinel/bfs-framing-intelligent-futures/knowledge/`:
    `&` → `and`, `,` → removed, `'` → removed, `—` → `-` in every filename.
