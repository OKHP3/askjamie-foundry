# AskJamie FoundRy

Portable Agent Skills, composed into plugins and connectors for the platforms
people choose. Existing Custom GPTs and prompts are conversion inputs.

The local workbench creates private skill packages and target adapter plans.
Capability projects move toward governed `capabilities/` subtrees, preserving
source identity and private controls. Start with the
[skill-first operating model](docs/skill-first-foundry.md).

## Two deliberate surfaces

The public Pages artifact is a read-only orientation to the AskJamie ecosystem:
[`public/`](public/) is source-backed and contains no private state or authoring
controls. Its expected project-site path is
`https://okhp3.github.io/AskJamie-FoundRy/`, subject to a separately approved
Pages release.

## Recovering a bad Pages publication

Pages recovery is a corrective release, not a database restore. The only source
for the public artifact is [`public/`](public/). Never copy, restore, delete, or
inspect `.foundry-data/`, backups, client records, or generated private
packages as part of a Pages correction.

If the published page has incorrect content or an unexpected link:

1. Record the live URL, the Pages workflow run, and the commit shown for that
   deployment. Compare the deployed content with the `public/` source.
2. Start a task branch from the latest `origin/main`. Make the smallest
   correction in `public/`, or revert the offending public-source commit on the
   task branch. Do not edit `dist/pages/` as the source of truth.
3. Run `python3 scripts/build-public-artifact.py --build` and the documented
   validation checks. Review the generated artifact and confirm it contains no
   private workbench or runtime content.
4. Open a pull request into protected `main`. Wait for the supported Python
   validation check, then merge the correction through GitHub. Do not push
   directly to `main`, force-push, or rewrite the bad release's history.
5. After the merge, manually dispatch
   [AskJamie Pages (manual release)](.github/workflows/pages.yaml) from
   `main`. The safe release boundary is the reviewed merge commit on protected
   `main`, not an unreviewed branch or a local workbench state. Confirm that
   the workflow run uses that merge commit before relying on its deployment.
6. Check the workflow smoke test and open the public URL. Confirm the expected
   path, visible content, and links. Keep the failed run and corrective commit
   as the recovery record.

If the source correction is not clear, stop after isolating the affected
`public/` files and ask the owner to choose between a narrow edit and a revert.
Do not use workbench import, deletion, or backup restore to repair a Pages
publication. The complete operating procedure is in
[`docs/workbench.md`](docs/workbench.md#recovering-a-bad-pages-publication).

## Run the workbench

The authoring workbench remains private and loopback-only:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m workbench --port 8765
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8765**. Python 3.11 or newer is required. No frontend
build, provider key, or paid inference service is needed. Private drafts persist
in ignored `.foundry-data/`. The local workbench can download a versioned backup,
validate a replacement import, duplicate a saved project, and delete it only
after explicit confirmation. See [the operating guide](docs/workbench.md).

Create a capability, define its behavior, add a decision flow or workflow,
record evaluations, and download a validated package. Decision exports include
a standalone offline runner. Assistant exports are editable instructions and
specifications for deployment through a separately chosen platform.

The [seven-element research](docs/research/2026-09-07-universe/universe-research.md)
explains the universe boundaries and current evidence gaps. Skillz is shared;
the three regional Found-Rys have distinct responsibilities and learn from one
another, with OverKill Found-Ry as the mentor pattern. See the
[current-state and maturation assessment](docs/current-state-and-maturation.md).
The [parity matrix](docs/parity-matrix.md) records which mentor capabilities are
adopted, adapted, deferred, or out of scope.

## What This Repository Is

**AskJamie FoundRy** is a public-source, owner-local capability-building application and governance
relay. Author assistants, decision tools and guided workflows; save revisions,
record evidence, and export portable skills with governed plugin/connector plans.

The durable asset is the **capability and knowledge architecture**. A Custom
GPT, Copilot agent, Gemini Gem, website page, or local agent is only a
*deployment surface*.

### Capability Registry

Capability repositories are represented in [`registry/index.yaml`](registry/index.yaml).
Earlier staged capability files and legacy folders were removed from this checkout
on 2026-07-27. The registry remains a governance record and does not prove that a
remote repository exists or is operational.

## Known Child Repositories

See [`registry/index.yaml`](registry/index.yaml) for the authoritative,
up-to-date registry of all governed child repositories.

---

## Relay Responsibilities

- Maintain portable skill and adapter scaffolds in `_template/`
- Maintain the child repo registry in `registry/index.yaml`
- Maintain manifest and registry schemas in `schemas/`
- Publish governance guidance for AskJamie, BrandGuard, and client-overlay repos
- Preserve lineage between core skills and organization-specific variants

---

## Working in This Repository

### Creating a Capability

1. Create a private Agent Skill draft in the workbench or copy `_template/` into private storage.
2. Preserve source and define the trigger, procedure, output contract, and conversion gaps.
3. Add plugin/connector adapter requirements for each intended platform and evaluate behavior.
4. Record the planned subtree in `registry/index.yaml`. Import into public `capabilities/`
   only after explicit public graduation. Follow [the migration contract](docs/skill-first-foundry.md).

### Validating Manifests

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-manifest.py path/to/manifest.yaml
```

### Checking Registry Health

```bash
python3 scripts/check-registry.py
```

## Governance

This relay is governed by the authority chain:

```
OKHP3/OverKill-Hill → OKHP3/AskJamie-FoundRy → Child repositories
```

All agents, contributors, and automation working in this repository must
follow the rules in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
